Challenge 1:
Given an array A consisting of N different integers where those integers are in the range [1..(N + 1)], find the missing element.

Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [0..100,000]
The elements of A are all distinct
Each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)]

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Example:
Input: A = [2,3,1,5]
Output: 4

Input: A = [6,2,7,1,4,5]
Output: 3
