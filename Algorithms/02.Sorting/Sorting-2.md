### Sorting Algorithm 2 - quick sort, merge sort, Heap Sort

#### Merge Sort
MergeSort requires a divide and conqure approach. Its broken into two phases - First step is to recursively divide the array in half. until it reaches a base case where only one element left. Second step is to merge subarrays back up every level. When we merge all the elementsm we have a sorted array.


#### Quick Sort

#### Heap Sort

Data Structures 3 - hash tables
Data Structures 4 - graph
