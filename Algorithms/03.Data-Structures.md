### Data Structures 1 (Linear Data Structure)
- Way to organize data to use it effectively.
- Using the right data structure reduce time complexity and sometime reduce space complexity.


#### Linked List
- Concept of Node - A node is a class of its own, with two general properties.A value(s) and reference(s) -(also called pointer(s))- to another node.
- Linked List is simply a group of nodes in a sequence.
- Each node contains a value and reference to the next node.
- Linked List have several methods:
- * Access - Time Complexity - O(n)
- * search - find a value in a collection  - Time Complexity - O(n)
- * insert - adds a node at a specific location - Time Complexity - O(1)
- * remove - delete a specific node  - Time Complexity - O(1)

##### Advantages
- Simple to Conceptualize
- Constant time deletion
- Constant time insertion
- Dynamically expand and contract

##### Disadvantages
- Extra memory to store pointers
- Accessing nodes must be read in order
- Cannot nevigate backwards
