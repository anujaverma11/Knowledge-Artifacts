## Resursion

Recursion is a method that calls a smaller version of itself in order to reach a solution.

##### When should we use Recusrion?
- Logic with multiple branching cases
- Deeply Nested data structures
- Unknown amount of loops needed


##### Steps to achieve recursion
 - Base case - Tells the function when to stop.
 - Recursive case - case in which it calls upon itself modifying the input parameters- Scope Variables - varaiables accessed through the parent scope
 - State - values that track progress of where you are in recursion.

1. Instantiate Variables
  a. track status, variable
2. Return results
3. Helper Method
  a. Instantiate
  b. Invoke
4. Base Case
5. Recursive Case
