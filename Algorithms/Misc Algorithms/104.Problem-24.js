  *  Problem 1: Bucket Sort                                            *
  *                                                                    *
  *  Prompt: Given an unsorted array of numbers which are in the range *
  *          of 0.0 to 1.0, and are uniformly distributed across the   *
  *          range, sort the numbers efficiently.                      *
  *                                                                    *
  *  Input:  Unsorted array of numbers in range of 0.0 to 1.0          *
  *  Output: A sorted array                                            *
  *                                                                    *
  *  Example: input = [0.897, 0.565, 0.656, 0.1234, 0.665, 0.3434]     *
  *           output = [0.1234 0.3434 0.565 0.656 0.665 0.897]         *
  *                                                                    *
  *  What are the time and auxilliary space complexity?                *
  *                                                                    *
