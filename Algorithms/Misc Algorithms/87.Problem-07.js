Problem 2:
Implement a Stack using two Queues.  Your Queue has the following methods:
enqueue: adds an item to the end of your queue
dequeue: removes and returns the first item of your queue
isEmpty: returns true or false if the queue contains any elements
size: returns the length of the queue

Your Stack will need to have two methods:
push: adds an item to the top of the stack
pop: removes and returns the last item in the stack

There should be TWO solutions to this problem:
Version 1: The stack should be efficient when pushing an item
Version 2: The stack should be efficient when popping an item

Time Complexity: N/A
Space Complexity: N/A
