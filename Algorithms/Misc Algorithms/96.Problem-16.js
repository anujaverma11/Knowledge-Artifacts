Problem 3:
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

In this case, the integers 0, 1, and 2 will represent the colors red, white, and blue respectively.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Example:
Input: [2,0,1,2,1,0,0]
Output: [0,0,0,1,1,2,2]

Input: [1,2,0,0,1,2]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
