Challenge 1:
Given an array, write a function that will randomize all elements of the array. Make sure that your algorithm is unbiased (ie. completely random), and that it remains random even as the input size of the array grows.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Example:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [4,1,3,5,2]
