### Data Structures 2 (Trees)
Store data that is naturally organized in a hierarchical structure.

#### Types of Trees
- Binary trees - each node can have upto two children node. ex: Binary Search Trees or Binary Heaps.
- Ternary trees - each node can have upto three children node.
- K-nary Trees - Where you can have upto K children nodes.

#### Binary Trees

##### Binary Tree Attributes
- Root - Start of the tree.
- Edge - Relationship between on parent and a child is called an edge.
- Nodes - Each node contain a value and children (upto 2 - left child & right child)
- Properties - Trees have a property root, which indicates the start node.
- Method - Common method to all trees: insert, search, remove
- Tree Traversal - Breadth first Search & Depth First Search
