Challenge 2:
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than n/2 times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Example:
[1,2,2] => 2
[1,2,3,3,3] => 3
