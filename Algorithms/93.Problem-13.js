Challenge 2:
Find the Kth smallest element in an unsorted array

Input: Unsorted Array, K
Output: Kth smallest element in the array

Time Complexity: N/A (Attempt for the best complexity possible)
Space Complexity: N/A

Ex.
Input: arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15] , k = 3
Output: 7

Input: arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15] , k = 4
Output: 10
