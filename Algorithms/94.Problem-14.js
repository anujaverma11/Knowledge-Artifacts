Problem 1:
Search for an element in a sorted and rotated array.  If it is present return the index of the element, otherwise return -1.  All elements of the array are unique, and were sorted in ascending order prior to the rotation.

Time Complexity: O(logn)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Example:
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] , 2
Output: 4

Input: [10,72,106, 4,7], 12
Output: -1
