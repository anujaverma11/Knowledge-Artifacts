// Write a function that takes two strings as arguments and returns a string containing only the characters found in both strings. Write 2 versions – one that is O(n^2) and one that is O(n).

// Time Complexity (first attempt): O(n^2)
// Space Complexity: O(1)

// Time Complexity (second attempt): O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(1)

// Eg:
// input: “abcde”, “cdf”
// Output: “cd”
