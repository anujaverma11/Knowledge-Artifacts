#### Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is a fundamental routine to organize data. There are many sorting algorithms to choose from. During making this selection, consider constraints and tradeoffs like:

- dataset type and size
- Stability Requirements
- ease of uderstanding
- time and space complexity of the sorting algorithms


##### Three Basic Sorts
- Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
