  The doctype declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

  <xmp>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"></p>
  </xmp>
  <p> The meta tag is put inside head of the document specifying the character in coding. The meta declaration tag for HTML5 is as shown below :

  <xmp>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="file.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="new_html_elements.css">
