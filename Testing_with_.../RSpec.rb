# Popular rubytesting framework
# RSpec evolved out of the idea of BDD.


# To install RSpec and its dependecies

# $ gem install rspec

# Then inside the project directory, call
# $ rspec --init

# to initialize two files in the project folder
# create  spec/spec_helper.rb
# create  .rspec


# In rspec specification word is used instead of word test. So all the specifications are in the spec folder.
